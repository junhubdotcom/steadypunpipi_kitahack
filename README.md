## Features

### 1. Smart Expense and Carbon Tracker

Carbonance offers users a seamless solution to track daily expenses (bills, groceries, transport) with automatic categorization and date sorting, uniquely integrating carbon footprint analysis for each transaction. Utilizing Gemini AI and the Connect Earth API, the app calculates and logs the environmental impact alongside financial data, empowering users to understand their spending and its carbon footprint. Carbonance provides flexible logging through text, image, voice command via a virtual pet, automatic bank and e-wallet (TNG, GrabPay) sync, AI-powered receipt scanning with Google Vision, and manual entry, enriched with details like images, location, time, and payment method to facilitate informed financial and sustainable choices.

### 2. Virtual Pet

Carbonance's Virtual Pet feature enhances user engagement in financial and carbon footprint management through an interactive AI assistant powered by Gemini API. This customizable digital companion delivers daily, personalized financial insights, spending analysis, and eco-friendly suggestions via an engaging chat interface. Users can also seamlessly log expenses and access other app features using natural language or picture input to the pet. To increase user stickiness, the pet offers personalization options with unlockable wardrobe items earned by completing quests focused on responsible financial habits and eco-conscious actions, transforming expense tracking into a more interactive and rewarding experience.

### 3. Visualisation and Insights

Carbonance's dashboard visually summarizes user finances and environmental impact with interactive charts of spending categories and AI-driven analysis highlighting trends and unusual expenses. It integrates carbon footprint tracking for each transaction, displayed in real-time charts, and offers AI-powered recommendations for reducing both costs and environmental impact, promoting informed and sustainable choices.

### 4. Gamification

Carbonance gamifies financial management and sustainable living through engaging features. Users set financial goals broken into AI-powered quests (Financial & Sustainability), earning in-app rewards like virtual pet accessories, badges, vouchers, and redeemable Currency upon completion. A Leaderboard fosters friendly competition in saving and carbon reduction (with privacy options and social sharing), while partner collaborations aim to provide real-world value to achievements. This system motivates users to actively pursue their financial and sustainability goals within a supportive and rewarding environment.
